# Limbo-Lane
A game demo made as my college NEA project.
I may or may not continue this at a later date.

The main features of this project are:
- A (mostly) fully fledged speech system that can also handle cutscenes,
- A card battling system that allows for extra card types and decks to be created easilly,
- A functional save system (truly revolutionary)
